# Admin-Dashboard
A top assignement. <a href="https://kalah26.github.io/Admin-Dashboard/" target="_blank">Demo<a>

This project permitted me to grasp the awesomeness of grid and svg formatted images.
I had so much fun layering this layout and deciding when to use flex over grid.

All svg files were curled from <a href="https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/">Pictogrammers<a> website.

The font was curled from <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator">Font Squirel<a> website under Copyright (c) 2010 by Typemade (hi@typemade.mx). All rights reserved.
